### Pizza Project
One of the first examples of Java script coding, it is a barebones receipt generator for a fictional pizza place.

### TicTacToe
Using JavaScript we made a very TicTacToe Program, very cool to develop a game, even if all the computer does is pick a random, open slot.

### ToDo App
Using DOM and XML we can create a ToDo App that actually 'remembers' what you put in it.

### Calculator
A bit more practical use for JavaScript.  Very nifty to code something that is so common nowadays.

### Space Station website
This webpage was an example homepage for a space travel company.  An exercise in general CSS use for styling

### One-Page Website
Going off of the previous exercise we added some personalization to the creation process, including a video.  We enhanced it further with a modal for the image gallery.

### Movie Theater
Using Bootstrap 4, we developed a simple site.  We enhanced it furthur using JavaScript to do pop ups and the like

### My Github Page
This exercise was the final assignment of the course. Enhanced later with JavaScript for the next section.  Very cool to have something that actually lives on the internet.
