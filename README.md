### Space Station website
This webpage was an example homepage for a space travel company.  An exercise in general CSS use for styling

### One-Page Website
Going off of the previous exercise we added some personalization to the creation process, including a video.

### Movie Theater
Using Bootstrap 4, we developed a simple site.

### My Github Page
This exercise was the final assignment of the course.  Very cool to have something that actually lives on the internet.
